# Fly_Stock_Scrapers

Utilities and scripts for scraping and working with Drosophila stock resources.

## Structure
- `FlyStocker/`: main Python tools and scripts
- `BDSC_RNAi_Stock_Search_GUI/`: GUI utilities and lookup TSVs
- `Experiment_Scripts/`: runnable experiments and helpers
- `Data/`: large, unversioned datasets (ignored by git)
- `Docs/`: documentation and slides

## Development
1. Create a virtual environment and install requirements if present.
2. Run scripts from `FlyStocker/` or `Experiment_Scripts/` as needed.

## Notes
- The `Data/` directory is ignored to keep the repo lightweight. Place large datasets there locally.
